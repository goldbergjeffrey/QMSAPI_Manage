QMSAPI_Manage
=============

QMSAPI enables QlikView system administrators to automate user
provisioning, task creation, and execute tasks using Microsoft.net.

This application uses the following page on QlikCommunity for reference
and guidance with setup and configuration of the api.

Thank you to Joe Bickley and Stefan Walther for inspiration and
guidance.
